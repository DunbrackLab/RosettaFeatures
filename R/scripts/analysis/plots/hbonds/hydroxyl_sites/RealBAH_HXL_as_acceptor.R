brief_description = "Measure the angle of the tyrosine, serine, and threonine BAH angle -- where the base is the heavy-atom base of the hydroxyl oxygen -- when acting as an acceptor",

long_description = "
Currently the BAH angle extracted from the database is measured wrt to the hydroxyl hydrogen instead of the hydroxyl oxygen's heavyatom base.
As shown for serine below, the angle HG-OG-H will be reported as the BAH angle.  This is a tough angle to work with, though, because
the coordinate of the HG atom may only be inferred and not directly observed.  Instead, it would be good to look at the CB-OG-H angle.
