# Features Analysis Benchmark Protocol Capture

## Overview
High-resolution crystal structures are assumed to be
thermodynamically stable, which means that each structure should
occupy a minimum of a high quality energy function. In particular, in
aggregate, Rosetta should reproduce local structure features observed
in the high quality crystal structures. Therefore if we relax native
crystal structures and observe systematic displacement of local
geometric features (specific types of bonds are lost, polar contacts
become too close, etc.) this indicates that when new structures are
predicted, they will likely not be stable in the lab.

In our 2015 H-bond paper, we observed that the interaction between
related terms in the energy function create areas of double counting
for certain types of interactions or contexts that may be maybe
difficult to observe in full structure benchmarks. By plotting and
looking closely at distributions of local features, it is possible to
gain a deeper understanding of the full energy that arises from the
complex interaction between the range of active terms and the implicit
kinematic constraints.

## Usage:

To install this package, in R:

    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("momeara/RosettaFeatures")

To install locally, run the ```install_local.R``` script or run the following:

    devtools::document() # if you changed function signatures
    devtools:build()

    devtools::install_local(PATH)
    
Generate features databases following the features_benchmark protocol capture

    https://github.com/RosettaCommons/demos/tree/master/protocol_capture/features_benchmark/README.md


Then to report features, in R:

    library(RosettaFeatures)
    libary(methods)
    compare_sample_sources(
      config_filename="analysis_configuration.json")

Where the `analysis_configuration.json` looks like (note the change removal of compare_sample_sources main dictionary from previous the pre-library version):

    {
      "output_dir" : "native_vs_relax_native",

      "sample_sources" : [{
        "database_path" : "native_features/features.db3",
        "id" : "Native",
        "reference" : true
      }, {
        "database_path" : "relax_native_features/features.db3",
        "id" : "talaris2014",
        "reference" : false
      }],
    
      "analysis_scripts" : [
        "scripts/analysis/plots/EXAMPLE_PLOT.R"
      ],

      "output_formats" : [
        "output_print_pdf"
      ]
    }
