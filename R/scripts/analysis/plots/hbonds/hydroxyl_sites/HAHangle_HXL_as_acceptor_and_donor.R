Look for the distribution of HAH angles -- measured from the hydroxyl hydrogen -- when the hydroxyl group
is acting as both a donor and an acceptor.  In such cases, the expectation would be that the hydrogen's location
can be more accurately inferred than in cases where the hydroxyl is only acting as an acceptor and there's little
other information in the vicinity of the hydroxyl group that indicates where the hydroxyl hydrogen might be.
