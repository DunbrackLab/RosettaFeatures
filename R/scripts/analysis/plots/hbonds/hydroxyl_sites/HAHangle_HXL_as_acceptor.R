long_description = "
Measure the H-A-H angle for hydroxyl acceptors.  Since the flags that are active during extraction can decide whether
the cosBAH angle reported in the features database is either the CB-OG-H angle OR the HG-OG-H angle, its worth simply
measuring the angle directly from the cooridinates. This script creates HAH angle plots for SER/THR and for TYR
acceptors -- both aggregate plots, and plots broken down by donor-type.
